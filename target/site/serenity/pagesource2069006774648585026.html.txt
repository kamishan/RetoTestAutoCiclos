      <h5>Last Updated on Dec 28, 2022</h5>

      <h4>1. NOTICE</h4>
      <p>uTest, a service of Applause App Quality, Inc. ("uTest," “we,” “us” and “our”), has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site uTest.com. This privacy statement covers the collection, treatment and use of any personal information gathered by uTest from our testers and visitors to our websites (hereafter referred to as “you”, “your”, “tester”). This privacy statement does not apply to third parties and their actions that we do not own or control, including, but not limited to, any third party websites, services and applications that you elect to access through our websites.</p>
      <p><b>Information collected from website visitors</b></p>
      <p>For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes only the user's IP address, but not the e-mail address. We collect only the IP address, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our website, aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>
      <p>The information we collect is used to provide you with and improve the content of our website. The information we collect is not shared with other third party organizations for their own commercial purposes.</p>
      <p><b>Information collected from testers</b></p>
      <p>When you register on and further use services provided through our website, we request certain information. Except for information which you provide in your profile or in connection with testing projects, we do not share any of your personally identifiable or transactional information with any person or entity. By providing your profile information or participating in any testing project, you acknowledge and agree that we may share such information with Applause Customers and other Members as we deem necessary for operational purposes. uTest is not intended for use by participants under the age of 13. To the extent any such users under age 13 participate in uTest, we obtain verifiable parental consent in compliance with applicable law.</p>
      <p>uTest will only collect certain biometric information upon notice and signed written informed consent on a case by case basis solely in the event such tester may voluntarily choose to participate in a certain testing cycle requiring such information.</p>
      <p>We will never sell, share or rent your information to any third-parties or marketing firms.</p>
      <p>If you supply us with your postal address online you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.</p>
      <p>When visiting ours or any client's website and signing up for or using our services through any Service Page, you may choose to supply us with information that identifies users personally. For Testers, this information may include name and contact information, gender, birth date, postal code, occupation and industry, shipping and billing information, behavior patterns, purchase history, and other information.</p>
      <p>The information you provide is used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine your eligibility for testing projects</li>
        <li>Contact you about your participation in testing projects</li>
        <li>Identify your articles, form posts, comments and other contributions on uTest.com</li>
        <li>Other information</li>
      </ul>
<br>
      <p>We collect non-identifying, general, generic and aggregate information to better design our web site and services. We may share the aggregate data with other third parties. With respect to security: uTest.com uses PayPal, which utilizes industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving Company and transaction data exchanged with our site.</p>


      <h4>2. CHOICE</h4>
      <p>From time to time, we may change our privacy policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should periodically check back at our website.</p>
      <p>Except as set out in this policy, we will provide you with notice and give you the right to opt out if your personal information is to be disclosed to a new third party controller or to be used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. </p>
      <p>We acknowledge that EU and Swiss individuals (as well as California residents) have the right to access the personal information/data that we maintain about them. To the extent you cannot correct any information by updating your uTest profile, we will provide you with access to and/or the opportunity to correct all information that we maintain about you upon your request. Please direct your request to <a href="mailto:privacydpo@applause.com">privacydpo@applause.com</a>. We will respond to you within the time period required by applicable laws, and in any event within 45 days of receiving your request.</p>



      <h4>3. ONWARD TRANSFER</h4>
      <p>Only those third parties which are set out in this Privacy Policy, or with whom you have transactions will receive your information.</p>
      <p>We may be required to transfer and disclose information, including personal information, in response to lawful requests by public and governmental authorities and law enforcement agencies, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your information (i) with our affiliates, (ii) service providers, (iii) if we are required to do so by law; (iv) if we believe that it is necessary to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements or otherwise protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Applause or that of our customers; (v) in order to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal obligation or government inquiry; or (v) to any entity that acquires any part of Applause’s current operations by way of merger, de-merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or (vi) Community Project Managers and Test Team Leads for administering testing projects. We may potentially be liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third party processes personal information in a way inconsistent with those Principles, unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>



      <h4>4. DATA TRANSFERS – EU-US, GDPR AND SWISS-US PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK</h4>
      <p>The Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of your country and the European Economic Area ("EEA") and, in particular, the US, which may have different or less protective privacy laws than those in your country.</p>
      <p>The protection of personal data is important to us. We process personal data only in accordance with the applicable data protection requirements, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Program to best protect the transfer of personal data from European Economic Area, Switzerland and the UK to the US and other third party countries. As a general business practice, we enter into Data Protection Agreements and other terms and conditions that incorporate by reference the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission as between Applause and our vendors and subprocessors.</p>
      <p>uTest complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information. </p>
      <p>Prior to July 16, 2020, Applause relied on its EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certifications as the legal mechanism to enable data transfers from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the U.S. Since July 16, 2020, we use Standard Contractual Clauses to enable data transfers from the EU, UK, and Switzerland. Although Applause no longer relies on the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as valid legal bases for such international transfers, we continue to participate in and will maintain its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.</p>
      <p>uTest has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>. With respect to personal data transferred pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework, uTest is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>
      <p>uTest commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. Where you have a complaint regarding our collection, storage, or use of your personal information, you may make a complaint to uTest via email to privacydpo@applause.com or via mail to 100 Pennsylvania Ave., Framingham, MA 01701.</p>
      <p>We will respond to you within 45 days of receiving your request. </p>
      <p>uTest has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/bbb-eu-privacy-shield-consumers/ProcessForConsumers/">www.bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/bbb-eu-privacy-shield-consumers/ProcessForConsumers</a> for more information and to file a complaint. </p>
      <p>uTest complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as applicable to our business. See Exhibit 1: “<a href="https://prod-utestv2.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/03/03/18/09/11/937a268f-1aca-4204-951a-11e7824ba411/DataProtectionInformationuTestMarch2021.pdf" target="_blank">Data Protection Information uTest</a>”

	</ol>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	<b>b. Industry Standards &amp; Guidelines for uTest Projects</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	As a uTester, you are expected to:
	</p>
	<p>
	</p><ol>
		<li>Never publicize customer information outside of that Customer's specific uTest test cycle – including customer/product name or any information revealed in a test cycle. This includes testing a competitor’s application and sharing information in any way. A recommended practice is to disable all applications with sharing functionality while you test. Due to the severity of this violation, infractions will result in the permanent suspension of your account.</li>
		<li>Never use file sharing sites to host any information from your testing sessions - instead, always attach relevant files directly onto the uTest Site (80MB limit; up to five files per report.)</li>
		<li>Never discuss or question payouts in front of customers, whether via bug reports, chat, disputes, or Tester Messenger. All comments related to payouts should be directed to the project manager.</li>
		<li>Never contact customers or Test Team Leads outside of the uTest Site (unless you are emailing a Test Team Lead, Test Engineer or Testing Services Manager regarding a specific current project). Additionally, never contact project managers unless it is related to a test cycle that is pending, active or locked. If a customer reaches out to you outside of the Site, please contact the project manager first for current cycles or https://support.utest.com/ for expired projects.</li>
		<li>Always be professional and polite when communicating with other testers, project managers, and especially customers (via chat, reports, disputes, and the Tester Messenger). The uTest project manager is available to review your comment before you share with a customer.</li>
		<li>Always follow test cycle instructions by reading the Cycle Overview thoroughly and any announcements from the TTL/PM in Chat. Additionally, utilize the test cycle’s Chat to clarify any questions (however, do not post a bug to the chat, or email the PM, and request if it is valid or not.)</li>
		<li>Complete each assigned task thoroughly and honestly. This includes test cases on both one-time and recurring cycles. Be sure to submit all required documentation for bugs and test cases, and to never recycle work from either your own past submissions or poach others’. Additionally, honestly completing work also includes never creating ‘placeholder’ reports for editing at a later time.</li>
		<li>If you accept a cycle or commit to a project (whether on the Site or in-person), every effort should be made to honor your commitment or to provide prompt notice to the testing manager of your inability to complete the project.</li>
		<li>Never create more than one uTest account or payment account or share them with anyone.</li>
		<li>Never falsify information in your uTest account, including but not limited to your name, location, hardware, software, payment instrument information and any other profile information available to be stored through uTest.</li>
		<li>Never use emulators, simulators, remote machines, beta software, or “jailbroken” devices for testing, unless otherwise instructed by a uTest employee. When testing, all third-party VPNs, SSH tunnels, proxy server connections, IPSec connections and other software or connections that could be used to track and transmit sensitive information—including but not limited to test application performance, features, capabilities and test instructions, results and artifacts—must be completely disabled while participating on any uTest Project or removed entirely from the test environment/device used for testing.</li>
		<li>Never ask or solicit the customer or project manager to approve your work, remove you from a cycle, or make you a favorite tester. If you believe your bug was rejected mistakenly, dispute the rejection directly from the test cycle or contact the Project Manager if you have more than five rejected bugs.</li>
		<li>If a project requires you to download a pre-production test/data artifact or application to your device, always promptly delete such Application or artifact from your device upon the completion of the project unless otherwise instructed by a uTest employee or the cycle TTL.</li>
		<li>If a project requires you to access a password-protected or non-public website, never access such website after the completion of the project unless otherwise instructed by a uTest employee or the cycle TTL, and always promptly delete any test or data artifacts from your device upon completion of the project.</li>
		<li>If a project requires the use of a proxy server, third party VPN or other connection or software that could be used to track and transmit device information, including features and behaviors of other installed applications, the connection or software must always be disabled or removed from the device when participating on any other project for uTest.</li>
		<li>When testing for projects that require uTest/Applause to ship you a device or type of hardware, you shall immediately return the device/hardware to uTest/Applause upon completion of the testing, unless you have received express permission (from uTest/Applause) to keep the device/hardware. Failure to comply with the foregoing obligation for any reason will result in the termination of your uTest account. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of such projects, if you have been vetted and accepted into a test cycle that requires shipment of hardware, you are expected to participate in and remain responsive to TTLs within such cycles. (It is not acceptable to become unresponsive to messages from test teams or Community Management while in possession of a shipped device.)</li>
	</ol>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Please note that failure to comply with these Guidelines will be deemed a breach of contract and may result in your account being restricted or closed. 
	</p>

	Additionally, except as these User Terms otherwise provide, the Arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the validity, applicability, enforceability, unconscionability or waiver of these User Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these User Terms is void or voidable. However, as stated in the “Class and Collective Action Waivers” section below, the preceding sentence does not apply to the Class Action Waiver. Additionally, the first sentence of this paragraph does not apply to any claims under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act. 
	</p>
	<p>
	If any claim(s) not covered under this Agreement above are combined with claims that are covered under this Agreement, to the maximum extent allowed under applicable law, the covered claims will be arbitrated and continue to be covered under this Agreement.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>b)</b> <u>Limitations on How This Agreement Applies</u>. The following claims are not covered under these User Terms: (i) Users’ compensation benefits, state disability insurance benefits or unemployment insurance benefits; however, these User Terms apply to discrimination or retaliation claims based upon seeking such benefits; and (ii) disputes that an applicable federal statute expressly states cannot be arbitrated or subject to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, including disputes that may not be subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreement under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act.
	</p>
	<p>
	Nothing in these User Terms prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with a government agency, including without limitation the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, National Labor Relations Board, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or law enforcement authorities. Nothing in these User Terms prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by these User Terms. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by these User Terms. Nothing in these User Terms prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration. Applause will not retaliate against you for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.
	</p>
	<p>
	A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy in accordance with applicable law, and any such application shall not be deemed incompatible with or waiver of this agreement to arbitrate. The court to which the application is made is authorized to consider the merits of the arbitrable controversy to the extent it deems necessary in making its ruling, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law. All determinations of final relief, however, will be decided in arbitration.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>c)</b> <u>Starting the Arbitration</u>. If either party initiates arbitration, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via U.S. Mail, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include: (1) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim; and (3) a description of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration by User must be delivered to Applause at Applauselegal@applause.com. The arbitrator will resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>d)</b> <u>Class, Collective, and Other Representative Action Waivers (“Class Action Waiver”)</u>. Applause and User mutually agree that by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, both waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a class, collective, and/or other representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law, and an arbitrator will not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any such class, collective, or other representative action. User also waives User’s right to receive notice of any class, collective, or other representative action that may be filed. Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, as defined below and incorporated herein by reference, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or other representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective, or other representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>e)</b>User agrees and acknowledges that entering into this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver does not change User’s status as an independent contractor in fact and in law, that User is not an employee of Applause and that any disputes in this regard shall be subject to arbitration as provided in this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>f)</b> Except as otherwise stated in this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, any arbitration shall be governed by the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), subject to the following:
	</p>
	<p>

The arbitrator shall have authority to decide gateway issues, including arbitrability.</li>
			<li>The location of the arbitration proceeding will be in the county and state where User last performed services for Applause, unless User and Applause agree in writing otherwise.</li>

			<li>The Arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties in accordance with any applicable federal or state law) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party’s claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes.</li>
			<li>Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver, the Arbitrator may award all remedies to which a party in his or her individual capacity is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration. The Arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is applicable.</li>
			<li>Either party may file motions to dismiss and/or motions for summary judgment and the Arbitrator will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions.</li>
			<li>The Arbitrator’s reasoned decision or award shall be in writing with findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision or award in any court having jurisdiction.</li>
			<li>The AAA Rules may be found at www.adr.org or by searching for “AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules” using a service such as www.Google.com or www.Bing.com.</li>
			<li>This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of disputes covered by this Arbitration Agreement. In the event any portion of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver will be enforceable. This Arbitration Agreement survives after the termination of the User Terms and/or after User ceases any assignment and/or relationship with Applause. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver also will continue to apply, notwithstanding any change in User’s responsibilities, position, or title, or if User transfers companies. Notwithstanding any contrary language in the User Terms or in any Applause policy or other agreement, this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver may not be modified or terminated absent a writing signed (electronically or otherwise) by both User and an authorized representative of Applause.</li>

	</p>
	<p>
	<b>c) Force Majeure:</b> In no event will we be liable for any failure to comply with these Terms to the extent that such failure arises from factors outside our reasonable control.

If such invalidity is caused by scope, length of time, or any or all of the foregoing, the otherwise invalid or unenforceable provision will be considered to be reduced to such scope, time, or area, which would cure such invalidity and render it valid and enforceable.
